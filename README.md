# Sensor-Circuits

There are two circuits

The first circuit is an analog sensor circuit. 
It uses soil moisture sensor and LEDs and sound generator to indicate the level of moisture in the soil. 
the blue LED and the sound generator turn on when the soil is saturated with moisture.

The second circuit is a digital sensor circuit. 
It uses PIR sensor to detects motion and turn the light on. Also, the sensor turns off the light when it detects motion again.
